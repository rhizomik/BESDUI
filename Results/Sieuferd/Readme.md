## Results per Task

In the following interaction sequences, it is assumed that foreign key relationships have been declared at the database level, as part of the schema definition. SIEUFERD will detect such relationships and make relevant joins available in the field selector, allowing the user to avoid the manual join dialog most of the time.

**Task 1**. [Find products for a given set of features combined](/Benchmark/1.md)
> "Look for products of type **sheeny** with product features **stroboscopes** and **gadgeteers**, and a **productPropertyNumeric1** greater than **450**".

| Interaction Steps                                            |  K |  P |  H |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----|----|----|
|1. Create and open a perspective from the "product" table|4|3|0|
|2. Make the "propertyNum1", "productfeatureproduct.productfeature.label", and "producttypeproduct.producttype.label" fields visible|9|7|0|
|3. Filter to show only products for which "producttypeproduct.producttype.label" is "sheeny"|4|3|0|
|4. Open the filter toolbox on the "productfeature.label" field|2|2|0|
|5. Click "stroboscopes" and "gadgeteers" and close the filter box|3|2|0|
|6. Insert a calculated field next to "product.label"|2|2|0|
|7. Key the cursor to the calculated column and type the formula "=[propertyNum1]>450 and count([productfeature\label])=2" (field references inserted by arrow keypresses)|17|0|1|
|8. Filter to show only products for which the formula is "true" (use keyboard shortcut since hand is already on keyboard)|6|0|0|
|Total Operators|47|19|1|

In the future, we expect to implement range filters so that conditions such as "=[propertyNum1]>450" can be expressed without the use of a formula.

SIEUFERD does not yet have a data export feature, although results may be retrieved in a transformed schema; thus we rate SIEUFERD 50% on the "Capability" scale for this task.
